# I/O Management

-   Basic I/O device features:
    -   __Control Registers:__
        -   __Command registers:__ CPU uses to control what the device would be doing
        -   __Data registers:__  Used by CPU to control the data transfers in/out of the device
        -   __Status registers:__ Used by CPU to find out what is happening in the device
    -   __Microcontroller:__ Controls all actions that take place on the device
    -   On-device memory [DRAM, SRAM or both]
    -   Other hardware-specific chips

-   __Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI):__ one of the standard methods for connecting devices to CPU

-   PCI express (PCIe) are more advanced than PCI-X or PCI bus [faster, more bandwidth, lower access latency, supports more devices]

-   Other interconnects:
    -   __SCSI (small computer systems interface)__ bus 
    -   Peripheral expansion bus [connects keyboards, etc]

-   __Controllers:__ Part of device hardware that determine what type of interconnect the device can  directly attach to
    -   Graphics controller
    -   SCSI controller
    -   IDE disk controller
    -   Expansion bus controller
    -   Bridge controller [handles differences between different types of interconnects]

-   OS supports devices via __Device Drivers__
    -   Per each _device-type_
    -   Responsible for device access, management & control
    -   Provided by device manufacturers per OS/version
    -   Each OS standardizes interfaces [by providing some device driver framework to manufacturers]
    -   Helps achieve device independence & device diversity

-   Types of devices:
    -   __Block devices:__ disks
        -   read/write blocks of data
        -   Allows direct access to arbitrary block
    -   __Character devices:__ Keyboards
        -   get/put characters (in a sequence/series)
    -   __Network devices:__
        -   Stream of data chunks of potentially different sizes

-   OS representation of a device: special device file
    -   Why? => OS can use any other mechanisms that are already a part of the OS to otherwise manipulate files to now refer to & access different types of devices
    -   In UNIX, all devices appear as files under `/dev` directory
    -   LINUX supports __Virtual 'Pseudo' devices__ to provide special functionality. Eg:
        -   `/dev/null`: accept & discard all output (produces no o/p)
        -   `/dev/random`: produces variable length string of pseudorandom numbers
    -   Device registers appear to the CPU as memory locations at specific physical addresses; so when CPU writes to this memory location, the PCI realizes that it should be routed to the correct device
    -   Memory-mapped I/O:
        -   Part of the 'host' physical memory is dedicated for device interactions
        -   This portion is controlled by a specific set of registers called __Base Address Registers [BAR]__
    -   I/O Port:
        -   Dedicated in/out instructions for device access
        -   Each instruction has to specify the device target (ie, target port) & the value to be stored in the register [value to be written/read from the device]
    -   Paths from Device to CPU
        -   Device can generate __Interrupts__
            -   Can be generated ASAP
            -   Overheads of interrupt handling steps [setting/resetting interrupt masks; cache pollutions]
        -   CPU can __Poll__ the devices [by reading status registers]
            -   Does at a time convenient for OS
            -   delay/CPU overhead

-   Using PCI, system can access or request an operation from a device using a method called __Programmed I/O [PIO]__
    -   No additional hardware support
    -   CPU _programs_ the device :
        -   Via command registers
        -   Data movement
    -   May have high costs associated with them

-   Alternative to PIO: __DMA (Direct Memory Access)__ supported devices
    -   Relies on DMA controller
    -   CPU _programs_ the device :
        -   Via command registers
        -   Data movement is controlled by DMA controller
    -   DMA configuration is more complex than a 1-step instruction
    -   For DMA, data buffer to be transferred must be present in memory until the transfer is complete => pinning regions [non-swappable]

-   Keyboards generally transfer data for each keystroke, so PIO approach is better

-   Typical device access:
    -   User process performs a system call to do the appropriate operation
    -   OS runs he in-kernel stack related to the device
    -   OS invokes respective device driver
    -   Device driver performs configuration of the request to the device using PIO/DMA approaches in device-specific manner
    -   Device performs actual request
    -   Responses from devices or interrupts will traverse the chain in a reverse manner

-   __OS Bypass:__
    -   For some devices, it is possible to configure them from user level
    -   OS simply maps device register share data to the user process (configuration) & then moves out of the way
    -   Requires a user-level driver (~library)
    -   OS retains coarse-grain control like enabling/disabling a device, adding permissions
    -   Relies on device features like sufficient registers
    -   When multiple processes use such a device, the device has to perform some protocol functionality to be able to demux data to appropriate processes

-   Synchronous I/O => process blocks while waiting for I/O operation

-   Asynchronous I/O => process continues & later checks to retrieve results, or process is notified on completion of the operation

-   __Block Device Stack:__
    -   Processes use _files_ as abstraction - logical storage unit
    -   Below that is the kernel File System (FS) which decides where/how to find & access file & are OS specific interfaces
    -   File systems interact with device drivers & would need protocol-specific APIs
    -   To mask differences between block devices, the block device stack introduces a __Generic Block Layer__ between the kernel FS & device driver as an OS standardized block interface

-   In Linux, `ioctl()` is used to manipulate devices

-   Linux uses __Virtual File Systems (VFS)__ that hides from the application, all details regarding the underlying file systems [whether one or more local devices or network devices]. Some VFS abstractions:
    -   __file__ => elements on which VFS operates
    -   __file descriptor__ => OS representation of the file. Operations include open, read, write, sendfile, lock, close, etc
    -   __inode__ => persistent representation of a file `index`
        -   Standard DS in UNIX based systems
        -   Because files may ot be stored contiguously on disks, so maintaining an index is necessary
        -   According to VFS, directories are files that contain information about files & their inodes
    -   __dentry__ => directory entry [corresponds to a single path component]
        -   Consider example of `/user/tezan`. VFS will create dentry elements `/`, `/user` & `/user/tezan`. When we need to find another file in one of these directories, we need not go through the entire path & try to reread everything
        -   The VFS maintains a dentry cache
        -   dentry objects are only in-memory [_soft-state_]
    -   __superblock__ => FS-specific information regarding FS layout. It maintains an overall map of disk blocks as to which ones are inode, data & free blocks

-   __ext2 FS (2nd extended file system):__
    -   1st block often contains code to boot the computer
    -   Rest of the partition is divided into groups (blocks)
    -   For each block group:
        -   __superblock__ => # inodes, # disk blocks, start of free blocks
        -   __group descriptor__ => describes the overall state of the block; contains info about the location of bitmaps, # free nodes, # directories
        -   __bitmaps__ => used to quickly find free block or inode
        -   __inodes__ => 1 upto max number; 128 bytes long DS; 1 per file; contains info about the owner of the file, some accounting info & info to locate actual data blocks
        -   __data blocks__ => file data

-   __Inodes:__
    -   Files are uniquely identified by inodes
    -   Inode contains all the blocks that correspond to the actual file + some metadata
    -   Advantages: Easy to perform sequential/random access to files
    -   Disadvantage: Limit on file size
    -   Way to solve the size restriction: Use __Indirect Pointers__
        -   Indirect pointers point to a lock full of pointers
        -   Larger files could use double indirect pointers
        -   But this slows down file access

-   Reducing FS overheads:
    -   caching/buffering: 
        -   reduce # disk accesses
        -   read/write from cache
        -   Periodically flush to disk [using `fsync()`]
    -   I/O scheduling:
        -   Reduce disk-head movement
        -   Done by maximizing sequential accesses
    -   Prefetching:
        -   Increases cache-hits
        -   Leverages locality of files
        -   FS can prefetch multiple blocks of data whenever a single block is accessed
    -   Journaling/logging:
        -   Write updates in a log [block, offset, value]
        -   Reduces random access
        -   Periodically apply updates to disk
