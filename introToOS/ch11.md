# Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs):

-   Intended to simplify the development of cross address space & cross machine interactions

-   Benefits:
    -   Higher level interface for data transfer/movement
    -   Error handling
    -   Hiding complexities of cross-machine interaction

-   RPC Requirements:
    -   Client/Server interaction
    -   Procedure call interface: 
        -   Synchronous call semantics: when  a thread issues an RPC, it blocks & waits until response from server [similar to procedure calls in the same address space]
    -   Type checking:
        -   Error handling
        -   Packet byte interpretation: Optimize implementation of RPC runtime
    -   Cross-machine conversion:
        -   Big endian ⇔ little endian 
        -   RPC interface should hide all such differences from programmer
    -   Higher-level protocol
        -   Access control, fault tolerant
        -   Different transport protocols

-   Structure of RPC:
    -   Server registers procedure, argument type, location, etc to be discovered [__register__]
    -   Client finds & binds to a server [__bind__]
    -   Client call to procedure [__call__]
    -   Client stub builds the message [__marshal__]
    -   Message is sent across the network [__send__]
    -   Server OS hands message to server stub [__receive__]
    -   Server stub unpacks the message [__unmarshal__]
    -   Server stub makes local call to procedure [actual implementation of the procedure]
    -   Appropriate response is sent back to client using similar reverse path [__result__]

- __Interface Definition Language (IDL):__
    - Serve as protocols of how agreement b/w client & server is expressed for the various operations
    - Describes the interface that server exports
        - procedure name, args, result type [similar to function]
        - version number
            - Useful to track correct server with latest implementation when multiple servers perform same operation
            - Helps in performing __incremental upgrades__ such that we don't have to upgrade all clients & servers at same time.
    - RPC can use IDL that is:
        - language agnostic [_XDR_ in SunRPC]
        - language specific [_JavaRMI (Remote Method Invocations)_ in Java]
        - Used only for specifying interface of the server
    - IDL is not actually used for implementation of the procedure

- __Marshalling:__
    - Marshalling code takes the variables in the procedure arguments & copies them into a buffer
    - It then serializes the arguments into contiguous memory locations
    - marshalling process encodes data into some agreed upon format so that it could be correctly interpreted at the receiver

- __Unmarshalling:__
    - The unmarshalling code takes the buffer provided by network protocol & based on the procedure descriptor & datatypes, parses the rest of the bytestream from the buffer

- RPC systems have a special compiler that takes IDL specifications & generate marshalling/unmarshalling routines to be used in the stubs.

- __Binding:__
    - Mechanism used by client to determine which server it should connect to & also how to connect to that server
    - __Registry:__ 
        - Database of available services
        - Search for service name to find service version & contact details of the server
        - Can be a _distributed registry_ used by any RPC to register
        - Can be _machine-specific_:
            - for services running on same machine
            - clients must know machine address
    - Needs some naming protocol

- Pointers in RPCs:
    - Using pointers similar to local function calls makes no sense as the server cannot get to the client address space to access the variable
    - Possible solutions:
        - No pointers at all
        - Serialize pointers: Copy the referenced data structure to send buffer

- Handling partial errors:
    - When client times out, it is difficult to tell the problem - if the server was down, or service was down, or network was down or message was lost.
    - Special RPC Error Notification System:
        - Catches all possible ways in which the RPC call (partially) fails

- __SunRPC:__ [(Tutorial)](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19683-01/816-1435/index.html)
    - RPC developed by Sun Microsystems for their NFS fr UNIX systems
    - Design choices:
        - Binding: Per-machine registry daemon
        - IDL: XDR (for interface specification & encoding in a `*.x` file)
        - Pointers: allowed & serialized
        - Failures: retries & return as much info as possible
    - Contains a __rpcgen__ compiler to convert `*.x` file to language specific stubs
    - Server registers with local registry daemon
    - Binding creates an _RPC Handle_:
        - Client used handle in calls
        - RPC runtime uses handle to track the per-client RPC state
    - TI-RPC: Transport Independent RPC (protocol used for client-server communication could be specified directly at runtime)
    - Client uses service name, version & procedure name to identify a procedure in the server while RPC runtime uses service ID, version ID & procedure ID
    - On compilation using `rpcgen`, following is generated:
        - `*.h`: Header file containing data types & function definitions
        - `*_svc.c`: Server stub & skeleton of actual server
            - main - registration & housekeeping
            - internal code related to all RPC services for request parsing, arg marshalling, etc.
            - actual procedure (must be implemented by the developer, & not automatically generated)
        - `*_clnt.c`: Client stub
            - wrapper for RPC call
        - `*_xdr.c`: SOme common marshalling routines used both at client/server side
    - Using `rpcgen` with only the `-C` flag generates code that is not thread-safe. We use the `-M` flag to make it multithreading safe
    - Using `-M` won't actually generate a multithreaded `._svc.c` server
        - On Solaris, `-a` flag generates a MT Server
        - On Linus, has to be done manually
    - SunRPC Registry:
        - RPC daemon - __portmapper__
        - To check services registered: `rpcinfo -p`
    - Client cab bind using `clnt_create()`

- XDR Data Types:
    - Default types: `char`, `byte`, `int`, `float`, `string`
    - Additional XDR types:
        - `const`: (converts to `#define` after compilation)
        - `hyper`: 64-bit integer
        - `quadruple`: 128-bit float
        - `opaque`: uninterpreted binary data (~ C byte)
    - Fixed-length array (`int data[80]`, where 80 is the actual length)
    - Variable-length array (`int data<80>`, where 80 is the max expected length)
        - Stored in memory as `len` (max expected length) & `val` (pointer to the address where data is actually stored) fields along with actual data

- XDR Encoding rules:
    - All datatypes are encoded in blocks of 4 bytes
    - Big endian is used as transmission standard
    - Two's complement is used to represent integers
    - IEEE format is used for floating point
    - Eg: Consider the following in a `*.x` file
        ```c
        string data<10>
        data = "Hello"
        ```
        - In client/server, it takes 6 bytes: 'H, e, l, l, o, \0'
        - In transmission buffer, it takes 12 bytes:
            - 4 bytes for  length (len = 5)
            - 5 bytes for actual data ('H, e, l, l, o')
            - 3 bytes for padding

- __Java RMI:__ [(Tutorial)](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/rmi/)
    - Used among address spaces in JVMs
    - RMI Runtime:
        - __Remote Reference Layer:__ unicast, broadcast, return-first-response, return-if-all-match
        - __Transport:__ TCP, UDP, shared memory
